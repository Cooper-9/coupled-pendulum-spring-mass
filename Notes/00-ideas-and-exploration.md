# Exploraiton of interesting problems involving driven oscillators/pendulums
Summarize our exploration of interesting problems and simpler variants that we can use to orient our understanding. 

## Some interesting quesitons to explore
- How do we calculate the center of mass for a complicated object
  - ...and how do we approach this problem if it is not ridgid?
- Can we understand and predict the dynamics of the driven pendulum?
  - is there a closed-form solution?
- How do things change when the pendulum motion affects the driver's motion?

### Driven rigid pendulum
**What do we know about pendulum motion:**
- Make strong statements about forces, _torques_, potential/kinetic energy
  - need to remind ourselves about polar coordinates and angular motion
  - $\vec{F}_g = -mg\hat{y}$
  - $\omega = 2\pi f = 2\pi/T$
- What do we remember about a pendulum
  - simple harmonic motion (_when_?)
    - **guess:** between $\pm 90^{\circ}$?
  - we expect that simple harmonic motion breaks down for large starting displacements of the pendulum
