# Exploraiton of interesting problems involving driven oscillators/pendulums
Summarize our exploration of interesting problems and simpler variants that we can use to orient our understanding. 

## Some interesting quesitons to explore
- How do we calculate the center of mass for a complicated object
  - ...and how do we approach this problem if it is not ridgid?
- Can we understand and predict the dynamics of the driven pendulum?
  - is there a closed-form solution?
- How do things change when the pendulum motion affects the driver's motion?
